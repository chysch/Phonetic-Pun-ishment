File formats:

    DICT:
        Every row is one word.
        ([.])?([A-Z]|[-])+(\([0-9]\))?(\t)([phoneme])([ ][phoneme])*
        Explanation: 
            The row has the word and one or more phonemes.
            Between the word and the phonemes there is a tab.
            The phonemes are seperated by spaces.
            The word is uppercase with an option for a symbol preceding and contained hyphens.
            If there is more than one pronounciation for a word, there are round brackets after the word containing
            the number entry for the word for all but the first entry for that word.

    NYM:

    RULE:
        Every row is one rule.
        ([rule])([,])([place])([:])([phoneme])([ ][phoneme])*([,])([phoneme])([ ][phoneme])*
        Explanation:
            The row has a rule, the place in the word to apply the rule and the phonemes the rule applies to.
            Between the word and the place is a comma.
            Between the place and the phonemes is a colon.
            The phonemes are in two groups of one or more phonemes each. 
            The groups are seperated by a comma, the phonemes are seperated by spaces.
        Rules:
            Replace - Replaces a set of phonemes with a different set of phonemes.
        Places:
            Start - The beginning of the word.
            Any - Any place in the word.
            End - The end of the word.
    
    TEST:
        Every row is one sentence in uppercase without punctuation.
    
    PARSED:
        For every sentence there are the following rows:
            1. The sentence in uppercase without punctuation.
            2. An integer (S) representing the amount of "correct" homophonic sentence matches found for the sentence.
            3-(S+3). The "correct" homophonic sentence matches found for the sentence.
            S+4. An empty row.
    
    FORE:
        Every row is one word preceding its phonetic build.
        ([.])?([A-Z]|[-])+(\t)([phoneme])([ ][phoneme])*
        Explanation: 
            The row has the word and one or more phonemes.
            Between the word and the phonemes there is a tab.
            The phonemes are seperated by spaces.
            The word is uppercase with an option for a symbol preceding and contained hyphens.
    
    BACK:
        Every row is one word preceded by its phonetic build.
        ([phoneme])([ ][phoneme])*(\t)([.])?([A-Z]|[-])+
        Explanation: 
            The row has the word and one or more phonemes.
            Between the word and the phonemes there is a tab.
            The phonemes are seperated by spaces.
            The word is uppercase with an option for a symbol preceding and contained hyphens.
    
    PHON:
        For every sentence there are the following rows:
            1. The sentence in uppercase without punctuation.
            2. An integer (P) representing the amount of phoneme list matches found for the sentence.
            3-(P+3). The phonemes matching the sentence.
            P+4. An empty row.
    
    RAW:
        For every sentence there are the following rows:
            1. The sentence in uppercase without punctuation.
            2. An integer (R) representing the amount of homophonic sentence matches found for the sentence.
            3-(R+3). The homophonic sentence matches found for the sentence.
            R+4. An empty row.
