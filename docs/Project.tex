\begin{abstract}
Creative speakers tend occasionally to instill in their words puns and multiple meanings. When the multiple meaning arises from the sound of the words, namely is caused by saying sounds that can be interpreted as two or more different combinations of words which all make sense in the given context, it is called a homophonic pun. The intention of this project is detection of such puns in given sentences if they exist and indication if not.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

\section{Method}

In order to find homophonic multiplicity in a sentence we decided to break the project into four stages described below. The stages are in a logical order and are modular and the basic logic is relevant for many languages. There are various features, however, that work only in English, so some of the modules will need to be changed to allow other languages.

We padded the logical core with a variety of hyper-parameters controlled by a rule plain-text file which can be easily created and modified by the user. These will also be described below. The general idea of most of them is weakening the accuracy of the phonetic match to allow more positive results.

\subsection{Training}

The first stage is preparing a phonetic dictionary. We called this stage Training although it doesn't contain training in the traditional sense (Usually "Training" relates to creating data via statistical analysis). Instead, we take ready clean-text phonetic dictionaries in the CMU dictionary format and prepare our own set of two phonetic dictionaries: A Word-Phoneme dictionary (called Fore) and a Phoneme-Word dictionary (called Back).

This stage is very simple and technical since it only requires reading a set of files and outputting the relevant information into two files. There are however various improvements which can be achieved by applying small modifications to the information as shall be explained in the hyper-parameter section.

\subsection{Analyzing}

The second stage is translating the plain-text test sentences into phonemes. In this stage we simply translate the sentences word for word into phonemes. Since there are words with more than one way of translating, the output in this stageis a list of matches for each sentence.

Since puns don't always cover all the words of the sentence (they usually don't), we added functionality to control the amount translated for shorter running time in the next stages. 

\subsection{Synthesizing}

All the preperation done, the next stage is creating a list of new sentences that can be composed out of words that phonetically match the sets of phonemes created in the previous stage. 

To achieve this purpose we created a phoneme search tree with words for leaves that the path to each leaf is the phonemes that compose the word. With this tree the new sentences can easily be created with a simple deterministic recursive function that scans the original phoneme list and traverses the tree to retrieve words. For efficiancy reasons we favored using a stack to which we add each relevant sentence beginning iteratively.

\subsection{Cleaning}

\subsection{Hyper-Parameters}

The rule file required by the user can be empty, but usually will contain values for the hyper-parameters controlling the project. Below the hyper-parameters are listed by name with a short description and motivation.

\section{Results}

\section{Related Works}

Although much work has been done on classification and detection of humor in general and puns in particular, we did not find written material on detection of homophonic puns.

\citet{yang_lavie_dyer_hovy_2015} searched for humor anchors in sentences and detected humor through them. They did not search for puns specifically rather semantically humorous constructs. Even though their emphasis was not puns it is important to note that the idea of working through anchors is definately relevant in this context - we used a similar idea in the Threshold hyper-parameter.

Various groups worked on pun detection and understanding. \citet{miller_gurevych_2015} used Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) to find the meanings of puns in corpora of homographic puns with only two meanings and exactly one pun word per sentence. Later \citet{miller_hempelmann_gurevych_2017} also continued the research comparing various types of WSD to see which method has better success not only disambiguating the puns but also detecting their existance and locating them. Unfortunately, the restrictions they put on their research meant that they were not dealing with homophonic puns.

The closest study we found was done by \citet{jaech_koncel-kedziorski_ostendorf_2016}. They cited various people who classified types of puns and analyzed puns theoretically. Their research was into understanding homophonic puns in sentences where the locations of the puns were already given. Since we are more interested in detecting if a homophonic pun exists and where, that approach was also not enough.
