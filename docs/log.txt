I have decided to write a log file to document the evolution of the project.

June 19:
    Started creating the work plan for the project.
    While thinking about the hyper parameters noticed that we also need to handle cases where two similar
    sounds are consecutive because that can also create homophonic similarity where in one case the sound
    appears once and in the other it appears twice. Example (brit): "No eyed dear" vs. "No idea"

June 24:
    Created a psuedo-code algorithm for the phonetic part of the project.

July 4:
    Created first version of training. Decided to leave the hyper-parameters for later since the 
    first priority is having a working pipeling. Created only the structure for the the hyper-parameters.

July 8:
    First successful synthesis of non-filtered sentence matches. Noticed that since the sentences are not
    punctuated, rather than filtering the invalid ones out, we need to check which ones can be punctuated
    correctly.
    
July 18:
    Implemented a hyper-parameter for replacing groups of phonemes. Discovered that current synthesis
    algorithm requires too much memory. Will need to redo it.
